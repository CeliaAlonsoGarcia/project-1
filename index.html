    <h2>How did I start learning?</h2>
    <p>I've been foraging mushrooms for around two years. First time I foraged some was in Hackney Marshes where I saw a woman picking mushrooms that grew in a circle on the grass. I approached to her and told me what they were, when I researched online it seemed she was right. That's when it all begun.
      A few months later I did a day couse with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildfooduk.com/">Wild Food UK</a> where they taught me the basic of mushrrom foraging.
      Since then, I've been self learning being now able to identify quite a few subspieces of edible and non edible mushrooms.

    <h2>Where to start learning? </h2>

    <p>It's easily to feel overwhelmed when trying to start identifying or foraging mushrooms. I recommend you start with
      one mushroom at a time - you cannot learn them all at once. You can focus on learning the characteristics of 
    the 3 most common mushrooms in your country on the current season. </p>

<p>Some of the materials I found the most useful when I started are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Books:</strong> I recommend having a pocket size reference boook you can take with you as well as
  a more extensive one to reference at home. These are they ones I used:</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/roger-phillips/mushrooms/9780330442374?gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUwiMmR8LWwP-7yHvxbUuAX9zoNMbQNIZKWqEGhTXLvRSUqpP8IOwFIaAphQEALw_wcB#GOR001984210" />Foraging: Pocket Guide</a> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildfooduk.com/shop/the-wild-food-uk-foraging-pocket-guide/" />Mushrooms by Roger Phillips</a> 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Videos:</strong> Watching videos of people foraging, giving you tips and showing you how to identify specific mushrooms it's a great way to learn.
  There's loads of people with great foraging video content online. I especially recommend:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/plot.81/?hl=en/">Plot.81 on Instagram</a></li>
    <li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wildfooduk.com/">Wild food UK</a></li>
  </ul>
 
</ul>

<h2> When is the best time to start learning?</h2>
<p>I belive there is not such thing as <em>best time</em> to start learning. Although it is true
  there are more mushrooms in Autumn but there are plenty of mushrooms you can identify in every season. </p> 

<p> The best time to start learning is <strong>now</strong>.
