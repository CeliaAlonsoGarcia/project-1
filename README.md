### Planning
When I started planning for the project I knew nothing about html, css or js so I focused my planning on topic, content and structure.
Topic - I knew I wanted my hobby page to be about either foraging or mycology. I decided to go for a mixture of both and wrote about Mushroom Foraging.
Content - I knew I wanted to include an intro about how I started foraging, tips about how to learn, some of my own pictures and some description of mushrooms.
Structure - I made a sketch with the information I had decided to include and how and where i wanted to include it. I decided I wanted a background with different mushrooms.


### Building

I coudn't start building it straight away as I didn't have the knowledge of how to do it.
I went to the Resources section and started with the first resource suggested: "Setting up a Webpage".
Then I read the html and most of the CSS sections of "MDN: Getting started with the web". I found this last one especially helpful as it encorouged me to create a page. Instead of following its exact instructions to create a "Mozilla" page I started using what I was learning to create my Mushrooms page.

I started learning basics like what was the <head> and <body> and how to add text with <p>. Then I learnt about styling with CSS and played around changing text colours, changing the background and adding pictures. In general I did a lot of trialing for practicing, trying things that I ketp and others that I knew I didn't want to use in my page like shadow to titles.

I kept the bits I was happy with and deleted the rest. 

At this point, I had a lot crearer picture of how HTML and Css work but I had done a lot of copying and pasting. I hadn't written enough code from scratch and it was easy for me to forget some of the sintax and didn't understand some of the CSS fuctions 100%. FreeCodeCamp really helped me with this, I completed a few of the CSS sections of the "Responsive Web Design" and did some more touches with some of the learnings. 

By now, I had a hobby page I was quite happy with but I was missing something: I needed to include a date and time to the website that would update automatically. Again, I went to the resources, there was a lot about DOM and how to add the date but felt like I needed some more undestanding about JS before I could dive in and attempt adding the date.

I started reading the JS part of "MDN: Getting started with the web" until I understood better how JS worked and what were things like functions or contants.

After i read this, I went back to to the other JS resources and read them all. I have to admit that I still struggled to understand how to add it but with the help of some Youtube videos I manage to add it and format it how I wanted it.
