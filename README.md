# Planning

When I started planning for the project, I knew nothing about HTML, CSS, or JS. Therefore, I focused my planning on the topic, content, and structure of the website.

## Topic:

I knew I wanted my hobby page to be about either foraging or mycology. I decided to go for a mixture of both and wrote about Mushroom Foraging.

## Content:

I knew I wanted to include an intro about how I started foraging, tips about how to learn, some of my own pictures, and some descriptions of mushrooms.

## Structure:

I made a sketch with the information I had decided to include and how and where I wanted to include it. I decided I wanted a background with different mushrooms.

# Building

I couldn't start building it straight away as I didn't have the knowledge of how to do it. I went to the Resources section and started with the first resource suggested: [Setting up a Webpage](https://oliverjam.es/articles/complete-guide-to-making-web-pages). Then I read the HTML and most of the CSS sections of [MDN: Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web). I found this last one especially helpful as it encouraged me to create a page. Instead of following its exact instructions to create a _Mozilla_ page, I started using what I was learning to create my Mushrooms page.

I started learning basics like what was the `<head>` and `<body>` and how to add text with `<p>`. Then I learned about styling with CSS and played around changing text colors, changing the background, and adding pictures. In general, I did a lot of trial and error for practice, trying things that I kept and others that I knew I didn't want to use in my page like shadow to titles. I kept the bits I was happy with and deleted the rest.

At this point, I had a much clearer picture of how HTML and CSS work, but I had done a lot of copying and pasting. I hadn't written enough code from scratch, it was easy for me to forget some of the syntax and I didn't understand some of the CSS functions 100%. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) really helped me with this. I completed a few of the CSS sections of the [Responsive Web Design] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)section and made some more touches with some of the learnings.

By now, I had a hobby page I was quite happy with, but I was missing something. I needed to include a date and time to the website that would update automatically. Again, I went to the resources, and there was a lot about DOM and how to add the date. However, I felt like I needed more understanding about JS before I could dive in and attempt adding the date. I started reading the JS part of [MDN: Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) until I understood better how JS worked and what things like functions or constants are.

After I read this, I went back to the other JS resources and read them all. I have to admit that I still struggled to understand how to add it, but with the help of some YouTube videos, I managed to add it and format it how I wanted it.

# Debugging

Some of the problems I had were:

- Having a bigger width of the `<main>` that goes inside the `<body>` than the `<body>` itself.
  Here I learnt to use _inspect_ in _Google Chrome_ to see how the diferent elements of a page are being targetted. Also, to strip everything out by commenting out `code` lines to see what `code` is affecting what elements.

- Learning to work with `Flexbox`. I knew I wanted to add pictures but didn't know how to add them next to each other. When I moved to _Project 2_ I started to learn about `Flexbox` and went back to _Project 1_ to implement it.
